Hi guys,

I am so sorry that I did not update my blog in past two years. But thank you for visiting here for anything.

Work is always so busy, and it is not easy to publish technology articles considering Huawei's confidential policy.

I am working on IP technology research and standards in Huawei since I joined Huawei, so I will publish some [IETF drafts](https:datatracker.ietf.org/person/cheng%20li), which mainly focus on SRv6, SR, PCEP, SFC, etc. Welcome to review my drafts, and looking forward to seeing you in IETF. 

Also, I designed the [IETF 103 T-shirt](https://github.com/muzixing/ietf103-tshirt). Amazing experience in IETF!

My Huawei E-mail is chengli13#huawei.com, comments or questions are welcome.


Best Regards,

Cheng
